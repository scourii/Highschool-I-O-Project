# Highschool-I-O-Project
SQLite Database written during the 2021 Ohio Highchool I/O Hackathon.

# Purpose:
Database was created for a learning app for children, it would contain information about their usernames, passwords, their ranking on the leaderboard for the week, and the amount of money they had to buy cosmetics with.
